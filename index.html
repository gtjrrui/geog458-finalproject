      <h1><b>Examining COVID-19 Cases and Hospital Capacity in the United States</b></h1>
      <h3>Made by George Thompson</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
      <p class="lead">With recent events, it was important to examine the examine the current COVID-19 Epidemic alongside data of the Hospital Population in the United States.
        The most important aspect to look into with the given data is to examine how the hospitalized population reflects the amount of coronavirus cases in each state.
        In recent news, there have been issues with hospital capacities throught the nation due to the increasing amount of cases throughout the country (<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/09/944379919/new-data-reveal-which-hospitals-are-dangerously-full-is-yours">Source</a>).
        Due to such events, it was important to examine the severity of such issues, and visualize the issue on a webmap for readers to see.</p>
      <p><b>Analysis:</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="lead">With the given data, we can easily find out that there is not enough capacity for all the hospitals in the United States to accomodate those afflicted with the coronavirus.
      The Hospitals with the Highest Capacities can only hold up to about 1600 patients at a time, while COVID-19 cases reach up to 1.2 million cases in total.
      In addition to the little amount of capacity, there are some hospitals that are incapable of holding any patients, especially in remote areas, but COVID-19 cases are still prevalent in the same areas.
      However, despite the given issues, it appears that most hospitals with the highest capacities are within states that are experiencing the highest cases of the coronavirus, such as California, Florida, and New York.
      Despite such information though, there are also counties that have cases of the virus, but do not have any hospitals that have any carrying capacity to aid the population, and sometimes completely lack hospitals as well.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="lead">The issues with COVID-19 Cases and Hospital Capacity appears to be extremely severe, especially with the given data. Although most cases of the virus do not warrant hospitalization of the patient, the amount of cases per county greatly exceeds the amount of patients a hospital can hold.
      With such information, the reported issues that hospitals have with their abilities to hospitalize patients should be of extreme concern, as they completely lack the ability to do so.
      As of writing this, the COVID-19 vaccine is being distributed across the United States, which will greatly aid with reducing the coronavirus cases across the country, which will also aid hospitals with their issues with capacities.
      However, in order to prevent further issues with hospital capacity in the future, it is essential to establish better methods of housing patients in order to help all patients during an epidemic. </p>
