# **GEOG 458: COVID-19 Cases and Hospital Capacity Research - Web Map**
##### Made by George Thompson
### Project Goal:
The goal for the project was to look into the issue of hospital capacities throughout the United States that was caused by the COVID-19 Epidemic. Such examination into the topic involved looking at the data regarding COVID-19 cases, alongside hospital data from all over the country. In order to properly examine the data, it was necessary to use the information to create web maps that portrays the COVID-19 cases and Hospitals throughout the United States, and examine the data from such maps as well. After examining the data, it was important to tell the audience what can be deduced from looking at the maps, and look further into the issues between hospitals and COVID-19 cases in the United States.
